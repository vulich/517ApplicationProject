This is a project applying various machine learning techniques to a single dataset. The dataset I chose is relates red Vinho Verde wine quality to several of its chemical properties. The dataset is from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). Each wine had its fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol measured in a lab. Each wine was rated on a scale from 0 to 10, using the median of at least three expert wine ratings.

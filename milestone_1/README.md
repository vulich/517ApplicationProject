# Milestone 1
For this milestone I did ridge regression on the red wine dataset. I used the python package scikit-learn to do the regression and matplotlib to create plots. To choose the hyperparameter lambda in the ridge regression, I calculated the 10-fold cross-validation mean squared error for various values of lambda and chose the lambda that minimized the error.
